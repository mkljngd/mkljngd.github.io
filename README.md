# My Portfolio Website

Hey! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a software engineer. I built this to give potential employers and collaborators a better sense of who I am and what I can do.

## What's in here

- **About me**: My journey from Mumbai to Boston, education, and what drives me
- **Skills**: The tech stack I work with (Python, React, AWS, etc.)
- **Projects**: Some of the cool stuff I've built, including a meal planner and route optimization system
- **Experience**: My work history and the teams I've led
- **Research**: My published papers on machine learning applications

## Tech stuff

I used Next.js 14 with TypeScript for this site. The animations are done with Framer Motion, and I styled everything with Tailwind CSS. It's fully responsive and works great on mobile.

**Main technologies:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Deployed on GitHub Pages

## Running it locally

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
