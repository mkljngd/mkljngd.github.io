Dear Hiring Team, 

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Mukul Jangid—a recent MS in Computer Science graduate from Boston University  and a former Software Development Engineer at Klaar Digital Solutions. While my resume outlines my roles and technical  proficiencies, I’d like to highlight additional strengths that reflect how I approach engineering, learning, and problem-solving  beyond the job description. 


**Software Engineering & Full Stack Development** 

• Took complete ownership of the Surveys module at Klaar, improving performance and maintainability. Introduced  linting and formatting rules, and mentored junior engineers on clean code practices. 
• Built a Spring Boot microservice in a team project at Boston University—quickly ramped up despite no prior Spring  experience and contributed production-grade code under tight timelines. Also explored and integrated tools like  NetworkX in academic projects beyond formal coursework. 
• Consistently emphasize scalable and modular code using strong conventions, structured outputs, and clean design. 
• Demonstrated a strong command of RESTful API design, SDLC, system design, and code review workflows—evidenced through full-stack ownership at Klaar and peer-reviewed contributions in BU projects. 

**DevOps, Automation & Tooling**

• Developed Python-based CLI tools to automate tasks such as expense tracking (Splitwise API), parse/filter entire  codebases, and video duration analysis—simplifying manual workflows I encountered in daily life. 
• Created CLI utilities to automate file matching, renaming, and validation across large video libraries, with robust error 
handling. 
• Hands-on experience configuring and deploying with AWS, GCP, Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and CI/CD 
pipelines—applied in BU projects, cloud deployments, and maintenance tasks at Klaar. 
• Regularly automate inefficient workflows both at work and in personal life, embodying a tool-builder mindset that  prioritizes long-term efficiency and clean developer experience. 

**Data & Math** 

• Strong foundation in statistics, calculus, and linear algebra, applied in ML based academic research published by  Springer. 
• Built data handling pipelines in Python with custom filtering, parsing, and normalization logic—applying financial  reasoning to ensure fairness and accuracy in tools like bill splitters (Splitwise). 
• Demonstrated cross-domain thinking in a Route Optimization project using Java (algorithms) and Python  (visualization), bridging graph theory, data handling, and systems design. 

**Adaptability & Problem Solving** 

• Learned full-stack and DevOps skills without prior exposure, contributed independently within weeks at Klaar. 
• Built over a dozen personal tools (e.g., CLI utilities, automation scripts, benchmarking suites) to improve workflows, simplify processes, and eliminate bottlenecks—with clear documentation and reusable logic. 
• Prioritize long-term maintainability, avoiding quick hacks in favor of well-structured, scalable solutions. 
• Demonstrated system thinking by building tools that not only work well technically but are intuitive for others—helping others with Splitwise automation or colleagues with formatted outputs in scripts. 
• Comfortable and confident across Python, Java, and shell scripting, with strong collaboration and communication habits. 

I’m currently exploring opportunities in: 
• Full Stack or Backend Engineering 
• Software/Data Engineering  
• DevOps & Cloud Engineering 

I’d be truly grateful for the opportunity to connect if my background aligns with any roles at your company. I bring a bias for  action, high adaptability, and a commitment to delivering clean and scalable solutions. I’m also a quick learner who  embraces feedback and believes in closing skill gaps swiftly to become a strong fit for any team. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I’d love to stay connected for future opportunities. 

Warm regards, 

Mukul Jangid
